# pnwflights22
An R data package containing all out-bound flights from SEA and PDX in 2022 + useful metadata.

This package was created using the [`anyflights`](https://github.com/simonpcouch/anyflights) R package. Additional data preparation was done to include additional rows of data instead of missing entries in the `weather` data frame.
